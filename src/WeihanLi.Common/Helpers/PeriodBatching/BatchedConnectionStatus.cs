/// <summary>
/// Manages reconnection period and transient fault response for PeriodicBatching.
/// During normal operation an object of this type will simply echo the configured batch transmission
/// period. When availability fluctuates, the class tracks the number of failed attempts, each time
/// increasing the interval before reconnection is attempted (up to a set maximum) and at predefined
/// points indicating that either the current batch, or entire waiting queue, should be dropped. This
/// Serves two purposes - first, a loaded receiver may need a temporary reduction in traffic while coming
/// back online. Second, the sender needs to account for both bad batches (the first fault response) and
/// also overproduction (the second, queue-dropping response). In combination these should provide a
/// reasonable delivery effort but ultimately protect the sender from memory exhaustion.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Currently used only by PeriodicBatching, but may
/// provide the basis for a "smart" exponential backoff timer. There are other factors to consider
/// including the desire to send batches "when full" rather than continuing to buffer, and so-on.
/// </remarks>
